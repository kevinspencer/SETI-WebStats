SETI/WebStats version 1.03
==========================

A simple Perl interface to SETI@home User & Group statistics.

The data availible from the server is the same as that displayed on the <Individual User Statistics and Group Statistics web pages.  In order to query the server, you will need a valid SETI@home account (i.e email address) or valid group name.
